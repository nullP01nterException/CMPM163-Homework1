HOMEWORK PACKET 1

PART A
The scene includes 3 objects: sphere, cube, and torus. The sphere and cube are textured with an image of Professor Forbes, and the cube is also reactive to lighting because of a Phong shader. The torus only has a Phong shader applied to it. All the objects in the scene move.

PART B
This program uses edge detection image processing. The colors of the processed image is also inverted. The amount of processing applied to the image is adjusted dynamically by moving the mouse right and left.

PART C
This cellular automata applies the 313 rule as described on https://softologyblog.wordpress.com/2013/08/29/cyclic-cellular-automata/
